# The perils of Word when publishing your book

> <q>My book is finished, am looking for a printer. It looks great! I did it all in MS Word!</q> 
> <br> -- plenty anonymous authors

# Target Audience

- you want to self-publish, or otherwise need or want to be in control of the part of the editorial, publishing and printing process that's waiting beyond the "typing it into the computer" phase and you want to produce professional looking results.
- you may have a publisher, but you're curious and want to know what might be handy. (For you: plaintext and high rez image scans that your editor **likes**. Period.)
- you're just one curious cat, you are! 😉

## Not A Target Audience

If you're fine with producing something that's easily recognizable as a "best effort" hobby horse. 
When your pinnacle of excellence is when you're rated in the family as the "dear uncle that's helping out granny with her garden and enjoying his computer hobby as a pensioner; he's a doddle."

# Me, *I* want to know. I use Word. 🥇

However, if you want to produce printed work that looks like it could have been purchased at Barnes & Noble or similar book-selling venues, you may need to gear up. Read on, pardner. 🤠

When "Word" features alongside "book" and "printing" or "publishing" in a conversation, you are having close encounters with the magical land where indeed "one word says it all"; all too often is "Word" indicative of a heap of trouble if you value your output and hope to produce a good-looking tome.

Als "Word", "boek" en "drukker" of "uitgever" in één en hetzelfde gesprek voor komen, dan heb je met "aan zekerheid grenzende waarschijnlijkheid" zojuist direct ervaren wat het betekent als men zegt: "dat spreekt boekdelen!" MS Word staat garant voor een hoop gedonder en gedoe als je een boek wilt uitgeven dat er goed uit ziet.

# 𝄞 What to do, what to do, when the Word Boys come for you? 𝅘𝅥𝅮𝆮𝄂

Checklist for authors!

- any images? (one is enough for YES)
- have you done anything to "tweak" your text to make it look nice? (Only good answers are: "I don't know" or YES. NO is like our (Dutch) PM having "no active recollection".)
  
  Have you looked what happens when you change the page size for your entire text, say A4 to B5, A5 or Letter?
  
  - did you enter any (breaking or non-breaking) hypens in there to "format" your text better?  
   
    ☞ Get them out, first thing!
  - did you enter any (breaking or non-breaking) tabs or spaces in there to "format" / "indent" your text better?  
  
    ☞ Get them out, first thing!
  - ditto for hard line breaks (Ctrl-Enter / Alt-Enter)?  

    When you change your page format you can spot many of those as the paragraph wrapping will be complete shot to hell.

    ☞ Get them out, first thing!
  - did you notice that the images are not where they should be any more?  
  
    ☞ Add text markers on separate lines where the images should *near*, e.g. `[image 1940-1]`. 
    
    ☞ If you need to reference images (or other stuff like data tables, use *figure references* and provide a separate list of images and their image references + subscripts, e.g. `see [image 38A] ...` & `Figure 38A: shot of the pool at Bellevue Manor in August 1938. Second from the left is Clara Doe, while James Patrick Doe, far right, is gazing at the tiles among her friends. This is the last shot where they still appear friends.`
    
- you didn't throw away or loose your original image scans, did you? 
   
  The images *embedded* in Word are totally useless to anyone who wants a good looking book!
    
  ☞ Bundle your **original scans** and "postprocessed derivatives" with your text. Make sure every image is in loss-leess TIFF format, or PNG if your scanner doesn't merit TIFF (see below). 
    
  ☞ "Processeed" files should be in Photoshop PSD format (or Illustrator AI format if we're looking at graphs or other vector graphics).
    
- do you know if the images have been scanned at scanner **hardware resolution**, i.e. have not been "processed" by the scanner software via "upscaling", etc.?
   
  ☞ When you don't know, make sure you scan the originals RAW or get someone else to do it for you. Scan at 300..600dpi for color, 600..1200dpi for Black&White, 48bit RGB when you have it, otherwisee 24bit RGB, even when it's only a B&W picture: converting to greyscale and color correction should be done in Photoshop, not in some HP or other scanner software that came with it on a CD or was downloaded as part of its installation: you can bet your bottom it's all crap.

  ☞ If your scanner is older, get [Vuescan](https://www.hamrick.com/). At least that one doesn't lie about your scanner's capabilities.
    
  ☞ when unsure, scan at the highest "color depth" and "image resolution" ("dpi") that your scanner **supports in hardware**. You can always downscale in Photoshop. The higher rez also helps (a little) when you are scanning newspapers clippings, etc. which must be postprocessed if you want them to look good in your re-print.
    
- when you have other stuff in there, such as charts, graphs, data tables, etc., always make sure you have the original files too
   
  ☞ We will need those to help you make it look good, for you'll have to do it all over again, this time in a **decent** DTP package that's geared for publishing. Word (and all its ilk: LibreOffice, OpenOffice, *whatever*) is **NOT** geared for publishing.
    

## Tips for authors who wish to self-publish

- get yourself acquainted with both Adobe InDesign and Adobe Photoshop. Both are industry standard tools, which makes interchange and communications easier for all of us. The  "alternatives" you find all over are just great if you do it all in your own shed end to end, but please don't bother the pros unless you are willing to fix everything that needs fixing on your dime and time. 
 
  Some use Quark Express. I have no opinion there. Quark was the moneyed choice back in the day when I was busy dancing with Ventura, 20+ years ago. Great stuff when we was young. Now it's been with Corel for ages and I'll revisit it if I feel *extremely* "retro". Until then, do like I do and learn to use InDesign if you're into producing anything beyond basic text-only novels.
  
- Learn to use Photoshop. Adjustment layers, color channels, color balancing, etc. When you are processing newspaper clippings (horror!) or other previously printed imagery, watch out for Moiré effects (interference patterns) in your final output. You'll need to apply some judicious blurring and, depending on the image, some other techniques too to arrive at an image that is "smooth" *yet sharp* that doesn't give you trouble when you re-print it. Be prepared to spend some time with Photoshop.
  
- Ditto for reprinting "analog photos", i.e. scanned photos from any age, but particularly old photos: scan them in color, even when it's black&white originally. Learn to use Photoshop to get the image back up. Reckon with a tough job when the original has beeen in the sun for a long time and is (very) faded. Getting photos that are *partially faded* to look good again is an art. "retouching" -- which will give you pains as 99.9% of the Internet is only interested in retouching fresh, new, women's faces for magazine and bridal shots. Because that's where the money is.

- proof. proof! proof!

  Get ready to run a few (that's 3 or more!) cycles of proof printing to get it right. Your scanner, your display screen, your toolchain, none of that is calibrated and fitted with verified color profiles, now is it?! Oh, newsflash for those that did invest in a calibrated scanner or other part: **your entire pipeline must be calibrated from end to end or you're toast, yet again!** 
  
  > This translates as: **what you see on your screen or even on your own home printer is NOT EVEN CLOSE to what you'll see when your work comes back from the printer's!**
  
- when this is your first time with a printer company, doing your own layouting and publishing and such, reckon you need at least 3 proof runs.
  
  ☞ and make sure your printer shop is on board with this and willing to help out, if possible:
  
  ☞ try to get your proof runs done on the same printer that'll do your book run; at least use the same paper and inks. 
  
  > This is only important when you're quite close to where you want this to be; paper type can have a big impact on look, so that's a primary concern.
  > 
  >  The printer equipment is another factor, because some printers like some PDFs better than others: for example, when you have very large images in your book, they *can* crash if you feed them something they don't like. Best to find out the right settings quickly.
  >  Personal experience includes fatal hassle with PDFs produced from a document including multi-layered Illustrator files in one project: had to flatten those originals before the printer would stop barfing a hairball around midway through the pages. Bugs and limitations are everywhere.
  >  
    
  ☞ If you get it right on your second proof run, you're either *lucky* or your standard of quality is 🤔 ... mindful of costs.
  
  ☞ If you get it right on your first proof run, you're *very* lucky. 🤔

  ☞ You can only expect to need fewer proof runs when you're doing repeat business: same printer, same process at your place, etc. Example: publishing a quarterly magazine.

- get yourself a printer shop that is easy to reach and talk to. When you're (getting into) doing very specialized stuff like art house publications (large format, full spread imagery for *connaisseurs* and such) you may need to look further, but at least I know my Mandarin is rubbish and my run sizes are so very *sub par* too: "printed in China" is not an option for the likes of me (and you, most probably).

- specific to the Netherlands? Very few printers are interested in small runs. Of course, the setup cost is spread across fewer copies, and so on, but once you get into the area beyond "basic novel in paperback", things get bleak.  
  Haven't met many that get enthousiastic about doing stuff like overprint (printing onto, thus *over* the edge), full spreads, or classic hardcover binding, let alone fancy stuff like fold-outs or tabbed cuts. Without further data, I blame it on the Dutch mentality: cheaper is better, so there's no place for printers with fancy stuff and a love for harder-to-accomplish output, or the (few) ones that can don't care about their internet presence. I don't know. 🤷  
  I've been regretting this since my youth and haven't found an answer other than "go abroad, try there".
